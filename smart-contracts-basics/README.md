### Tutorial 1: The Basics

- Introduction to Smart Contracts
- Setting up your Solidity Development Environment
- Writing your First Smart Contract
- Understanding Basic Solidity Syntax and Structure

### Tutorial 2: Inheritance in Smart Contracts

- Exploring Inheritance in Solidity
- Building Inherited Contracts
- Practical Use Cases and Examples

### Tutorial 3: Advanced Concepts

- Visibility and Access Control in Smart Contracts
- Utilizing Modifiers for Reusable Code
- Effective Error Handling with `require`, `revert`, and `assert`
- [Practical Exercise: VisibilityDemoContract](#practical-exercise-visibilitydemocontract)

#### Practical Exercise: VisibilityDemoContract

This exercise focuses on understanding different visibility levels (`private`, `public`, `internal`, `external`) in Solidity. You will create a contract named `VisibilityDemoContract` to explore these concepts practically. The exercise includes a step-by-step guide and learning outcomes.

### Tutorial 4: Imports and Libraries

- Importing External Contracts and Files
- Creating and Using Libraries in Solidity
- Best Practices for Code Reusability and Modularity
