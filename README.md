## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1:

### Q2: Are the videos downloadable?

Yes! I made all videos downloadable from YouTube so you can learn even without an internet connection.

### Q3: I want to put the project in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built it yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

### Q4: Do you accept pull requests?
No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
